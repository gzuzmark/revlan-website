They have innovated the way of learning a second language, in this case English, in a dynamic, fun and dosed way for children and young people. Camilu is happy in the shows because they enjoy and learn naturally without pressures. What I also loved is the social responsibility of the project, providing part of the profits to a social case. I highly recommend them!”",
      "testimony2": "“I am very happy and grateful for the innovative initiative of Revlan led by Sarah and Benja, who teach English to children through interactive shows. Particularly, my 6-year-old daughter is not only learning the correct pronunciation of English but also having fun with other children from different parts of the country and the world. The shows are full of dynamic games where children enjoy learning another language. There are no fearful or embarrassed children; you only perceive happy children. That's why I recommend REVLAN.”",
      "testimony3": "“I'm so happy with the teaching method they have with the kids, they recommended these shows to me and I really don't regret it at all, quite the opposite, my son is very happy to learn English every day with this fun methodology, Thanks Benja and Sarah, I strongly recommend them!”"
